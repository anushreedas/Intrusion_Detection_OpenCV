# Intrusion_Detection_OpenCV

An adaptive software which will detect an intruder in the scene, using adaptive long-term and short-term memory models that compensate for the changing lighting and shadow conditions. The intruder is detected as a relatively sudden change from a previous frame, combined with along-term change from the background.
